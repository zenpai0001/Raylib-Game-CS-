Having averted the lockdown and
consumed the entire crew of EFF
Mill Bay, the mysterious
creature boarded a lifeboat and
was jettisoned safely to earth.
By the time Mill Bay's black 
box recorder was recovered and 
the cause of her demise became 
known, the creature had 
vanished into the wilderness. 
We can only hope that it cannot
propagate by itself.
